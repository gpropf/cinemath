This is the python program that I used to generate the movies on my YouTube channel [Strange Loops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMy7xzWIQV4J16ZoZiPMPA/featured?view_as=subscriber).
I originally intended this as nothing more than an experiment to make a cool design for a class I was taking on laser cutters. You will thus perhaps note that the software engineering here is abysmal, global variables, parameters hardcoded as literals, everything but goto statements. Well since the movies have been getting a little bit of notice maybe I'll fix this thing up and make a proper program out of it. Actually, I regret doing it in Python now - way too slow for this kind of numeric intensive stuff. I suspect I'll fix the Python code to make it more manageable and then rewrite the whole thing in Haskell eventually.
